# advent-of-code-2023
My 2023 attempt at the https://adventofcode.com/ challenge.

Competing against my colleagues at the very group, although this year, again, I don't really have the time or headspace to do it properly. 
Don't expect nice or smart code, this is panic coding at its finest. 
I will however build on last year and unit test (with [ts-jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)) as much as possible. 

## Typescript setup

I always forget how to get there so, for the record
```
npm i typescript --save-dev 
npm i --save-dev @types/node
npm i --location=global ts-node
npm i ts-node --save-dev
npx tsc --init

npm i --save-dev ts-jest
npm i --save-dev @jest/globals

npx ts-jest config:init

ts-node aoc2023-fn.ts 7 1 test
ts-node aoc2023-fn.ts 7 2

npm test -- day00/Day00.test.ts
```

I'm not being particularly smart with TS, but using strong types saves me from pretty stupid mistakes. 

## Adding a new day

I've created [hygen](https://www.hygen.io/docs/quick-start) templates.
Once hygen is installed (`npm i -g hygen`) adding a new day is as simple as typing:

`hygen day add --day 6`

## ⭐⭐ Day 1: Historian Hysteria

Easy enough, just wish it hadn't been a Sunday. Ended up doing it at bed time.
But at least this new repo is ready
